1. Why does inline style CSS override rules defined in style elements and external
stylesheets?
    Inline styling will override rules defined elsewhere because it is the last rule applied to an element.

2. Give a brief example of when to use ID ( #id ) and when to use classes ( .class ) in CSS.
    ID should be used when you need to target unique elements, while Classes should be used to target multiple elements.
    For example you could make a bibliography where all the elements have the same class to target them for styling, but different IDs to target them when linking internally.

3. What does RGBA mean and what colors can you express with it?
    RGBA means red, green, blue and alpha. With RGBA you can target 256^3(24bit) different colors, composed of red, green and blue, at 256 different levels of opacity.

4. Why do we include CSS files inside the head element and not inside the body element?
    By including CSS files in the head element we make sure that the stylesheets are loaded before rendering the site.
    If the CSS is included in the body element the site has to render twice, once without CSS, and then once more when the CSS file is parsed. 

5. What CSS selector matches all the p elements inside the article element in the
    "article p" will select all p elements which are nested inside an article element.
